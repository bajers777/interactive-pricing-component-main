## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I've made my first very simple range slider in JS and I'm very proud of myself :).

Also at this moment I'll learn and use SCSS or at least variables in CSS, in my next projects.
